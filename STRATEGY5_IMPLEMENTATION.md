# Strategy 5: Stats-Driven Guardrails - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Strategy 5 allows users to create fantasy teams by applying user-defined statistical filters based on player performance. The system filters players according to Dream Team percentage (mandatory), Selection percentage, Average points, and Credits to generate teams that align with user criteria.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. User Interface (Strategy5Wizard.tsx)
- **Filter Setup Form**: Interactive UI with sliders for setting numerical ranges
- **Mandatory Filters**: Dream Team % is required for all teams  
- **Optional Filters**: Selection %, Average Points, Credits
- **Role Composition**: Min/max players per role (WK, BAT, AR, BWL)
- **Validation**: Ensures at least one additional filter besides Dream Team % is set
- **Summary Stage**: Shows configured filters before team generation

### 2. Backend Logic (ai-service-enhanced.ts)
- **Statistical Filtering**: `applyStatsFilters()` method filters players based on user criteria
- **Smart Defaults**: Optional filters only applied when not at default values
- **Team Variation**: Ensures 10%+ difference between teams through:
  - Randomized player selection within filtered pool
  - Different starting points for each team
  - Role count variation across teams
- **Fallback Logic**: Relaxes filters if too restrictive, then falls back to basic team generation

### 3. Filtering Logic
```typescript
// Dream Team % (mandatory)
if (dreamTeamPercentage < filters.dreamTeamPercentage.min || 
    dreamTeamPercentage > filters.dreamTeamPercentage.max) {
  return false;
}

// Optional filters only applied when not at defaults
if (filters.selectionPercentage && 
    (filters.selectionPercentage.min > 0 || filters.selectionPercentage.max < 100)) {
  // Apply selection percentage filter
}
```

### 4. Team Generation Process
1. **Filter Application**: Apply all user-defined statistical filters
2. **Role Grouping**: Group filtered players by role (WK, BAT, AR, BWL)  
3. **Team Assembly**: Select players within role constraints and budget
4. **Validation**: Ensure Dream11 rules compliance
5. **C/VC Selection**: Rotate captain/vice-captain combinations
6. **Insights Generation**: Create detailed performance insights

### 5. Validation and Error Handling
- **Filter Validation**: Ensures at least one additional filter is set
- **Range Validation**: Checks min/max values are logical
- **Player Availability**: Handles cases where filters are too restrictive
- **Graceful Fallback**: Relaxes filters or uses fallback team generation

## User Workflow
1. **Set Filters**: User defines Dream Team % (mandatory) + at least one additional filter
2. **Configure Roles**: Set min/max players per role
3. **Review Summary**: Preview filter settings and expected team composition
4. **Generate Teams**: Create X teams with at least 10% variation
5. **Review Results**: View teams with detailed insights and statistics

## Data Structure
```typescript
interface Filters {
  dreamTeamPercentage: { min: number; max: number };    // Mandatory
  selectionPercentage?: { min: number; max: number };   // Optional
  averagePoints?: { min: number; max: number };         // Optional
  credits?: { min: number; max: number };               // Optional
  playerRoles: {
    batsmen: { min: number; max: number };
    bowlers: { min: number; max: number };
    allRounders: { min: number; max: number };
    wicketKeepers: { min: number; max: number };
  };
}
```

## Generated Insights
- Average Dream Team % of selected players
- Average Selection % (if filter applied)
- Average Points (if filter applied)
- Average Credits (if filter applied)
- Player pool size after filtering
- Team role composition breakdown

## Example Usage
**User Input:**
- Dream Team %: 40-60%
- Selection %: 20-50%
- Average Points: 35-75
- Batsmen: 3-5, Bowlers: 3-5, All-Rounders: 2-4, WK: 1-2

**Generated Summary:**
"Generating teams with balanced Dream Team performers and differential low-ownership picks focusing on in-form performers."

## Technical Implementation
- **Strategy Detection**: `strategy === 'stats-driven'`
- **API Integration**: `/api/teams/generate` endpoint
- **Database**: Uses `dream_team_percentage` field in Player table
- **Validation**: Full Dream11 rules compliance
- **Variation**: Mathematical team diversity algorithms

## Compliance with Requirements
✅ Dream Team % mandatory filter
✅ At least one additional filter required
✅ Strict user-defined criteria adherence
✅ 10%+ team variation
✅ Captain/vice-captain rotation
✅ Dream11 rules compliance
✅ Graceful error handling
✅ Detailed user insights

The implementation strictly follows the markdown specification, ensuring teams are generated based purely on user-defined statistical criteria without additional balancing logic.
