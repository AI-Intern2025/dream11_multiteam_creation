## Files Modified
1. `lib/ai-service-enhanced.ts` - Added preset strategy handling
2. `app/match/[id]/teams/page.tsx` - Updated strategy routing
3. `components/strategies/Strategy6Wizard.tsx` - Enhanced UI

## Key Features
- ✅ 11 predefined preset scenarios
- ✅ Role distribution constraints
- ✅ Team preference settings
- ✅ Selection threshold filtering
- ✅ Match context awareness
- ✅ Budget optimization
- ✅ Captain/VC selection logic
- ✅ Risk/confidence scoring
- ✅ Error handling & fallbacks
- ✅ Dream11 rule compliance

## Usage
1. Navigate to Strategy 6 from match page
2. Select preset from card interface
3. Configure team count (1-50)
4. Click "Generate Teams"
5. System applies constraints and generates teams

## API Integration
- Strategy name: `preset-scenarios`
- Integrates with existing `/api/teams/generate` endpoint
- Uses `presetStrategyService` for team generation
- Fallback to regular generation on errors

## Preset Categories
- **Team-Based**: Focus on specific team performance
- **Differential**: Low-ownership, high-upside picks
- **Balanced**: Traditional, reliable compositions
- **League-Specific**: Optimized for contest types
- **Match Context**: Adapted to match conditions
- **Specialized**: Unique strategic approaches

## Testing
- All presets defined with proper constraints
- Error handling for invalid configurations
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures
- UI validation for user inputs

## Configuration
Presets are easily configurable through `preset-configurations.ts`:
- Add new presets by extending `PRESET_CONFIGURATIONS` array
- Modify constraints for existing presets
- Update risk levels and role distributions
- Adjust selection thresholds

The implementation is production-ready and fully integrated with the existing system architecture.
