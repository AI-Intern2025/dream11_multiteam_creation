# Strategy 6: Team Diversity Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced Strategy 6 to ensure each generated team has a **minimum of 25% different players** from all other teams. This means at least 3 out of 11 players (27%) must be unique in each team.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Algorithm Changes

#### **New Method: `generateDiversePresetTeam`**
- Replaces the original `generateSinglePresetTeam` in the main generation loop
- Implements iterative team generation with diversity checking
- Balances preset constraints with diversity requirements

#### **Diversity Requirements**
- **Minimum Different Players**: 3 out of 11 (25%+)
- **Calculation**: `Math.ceil(11 * 0.25) = 3 players`
- **Applied**: Against every existing team, not just average

### 2. Key Features

#### **Player Diversity Scoring**
```typescript
private calculateDiversityScore(player: Player, existingTeams: Player[][]): number {
  const usageCount = existingTeams.reduce((count, team) => {
    return count + (team.some(p => p.id === player.id) ? 1 : 0);
  }, 0);
  
  const usagePercentage = usageCount / existingTeams.length;
  return 1 - usagePercentage; // Higher score for less used players
}
```

#### **Balanced Scoring System**
- **Original Score**: Preset constraint compliance
- **Diversity Score**: Usage frequency in existing teams
- **Final Score**: `originalScore + (diversityScore * 50)`

#### **Iterative Generation**
- **Max Attempts**: 100 iterations per team
- **Fallback**: Uses original method if diversity cannot be achieved
- **Progress**: Each attempt varies player selection starting points

### 3. Diversity Validation

#### **Team Diversity Check**
```typescript
private checkTeamDiversity(
  newTeam: Player[], 
  existingTeams: Player[][], 
  minDifferentPlayers: number
): boolean {
  for (const existingTeam of existingTeams) {
    const commonPlayers = newTeam.filter(p => 
      existingTeam.some(ep => ep.id === p.id)
    ).length;
    
    const differentPlayers = 11 - commonPlayers;
    
    if (differentPlayers < minDifferentPlayers) {
      return false; // Not diverse enough
    }
  }
  return true; // Meets diversity requirements
}
```

#### **Diversity Percentage Calculation**
- Calculates minimum diversity percentage across all existing teams
- Displayed in team insights for transparency
- Used for quality assessment and user feedback

### 4. Enhanced User Experience

#### **Team Insights**
- Shows actual diversity percentage achieved
- Displays role distribution and credits
- Includes risk level and expected points
- Provides transparency into team generation

#### **Reasoning Updates**
- Mentions diversity achievement in team reasoning
- Example: "Generated using Balanced Roles preset strategy with 45.5% diversity from other teams"

### 5. Technical Implementation

#### **Data Structures**
- **`existingTeams: Player[][]`**: Tracks all previously generated teams
- **`selectedPlayers: Player[]`**: Current team being built
- **`diversityScore: number`**: Player usage frequency metric

#### **Algorithm Flow**
1. **Initialize**: Set up role requirements and diversity thresholds
2. **Iterate**: Try different player combinations up to max attempts
3. **Score**: Balance preset constraints with diversity requirements
4. **Validate**: Check if team meets 25% diversity requirement
5. **Finalize**: Return valid team or fallback to original method

#### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Early Exit**: Stop when valid diverse team is found
- **Efficient Filtering**: Pre-filter players by role and constraints
- **Smart Rotation**: Vary starting positions to increase diversity chances
- **Fallback Protection**: Prevent infinite loops with attempt limits

### 6. Edge Cases Handled

#### **Insufficient Players**
- **Issue**: Not enough players to maintain diversity
- **Solution**: Fallback to original generation method
- **Feedback**: Warning logged for monitoring

#### **First Team**
- **Issue**: No existing teams to compare against
- **Solution**: First team always considered valid
- **Behavior**: Subsequent teams must differ from first team

#### **High Team Counts**
- **Issue**: Maintaining diversity with 20+ teams
- **Solution**: Continuous diversity scoring and smart selection
- **Monitoring**: Track diversity percentages across all teams

### 7. Testing Scenarios

#### **Diversity Verification**
- Generate 10 teams and verify each has 3+ unique players
- Check distribution of player usage across teams
- Validate that no team shares more than 8 players with another

#### **Performance Testing**
- Test generation time with 50 teams
- Monitor memory usage with large player pools
- Verify fallback mechanism activation

#### **Edge Case Testing**
- Test with limited player pools (< 20 players)
- Verify behavior with identical preset constraints
- Test captain/vice-captain diversity across teams

### 8. Monitoring and Analytics

#### **Diversity Metrics**
- Track average diversity percentage across all teams
- Monitor fallback method usage frequency
- Measure generation time impact

#### **Quality Assurance**
- Log when diversity requirements cannot be met
- Track player distribution patterns
- Monitor preset constraint compliance

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Each team feels unique and strategic
2. **Increased Contest Success**: Better coverage of different player combinations
3. **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminates near-duplicate teams
4. **Transparent Process**: Users can see diversity metrics in team insights
5. **Balanced Approach**: Maintains preset strategy while ensuring variety

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable Diversity**: Allow users to adjust diversity percentage
2. **Role-Based Diversity**: Ensure diversity within specific roles
3. **Captain Diversity**: Rotate captains more aggressively
4. **Advanced Metrics**: More sophisticated diversity scoring
5. **Machine Learning**: Predict optimal diversity patterns

This implementation ensures that Strategy 6 generates truly diverse teams while maintaining the strategic focus of each preset configuration.
