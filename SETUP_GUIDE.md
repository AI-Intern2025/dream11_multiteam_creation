## 🔧 Missing: Database Configuration

You just need to set up Neon DB to complete the implementation:

### Step 1: Create Neon Database
1. Go to [https://neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new database
4. Copy the connection string

### Step 2: Update Environment
Replace this line in your `.env.local`:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_url_here
```

With your actual Neon connection string:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host/database?sslmode=require
```

### Step 3: Set up Schema
1. Connect to your Neon database
2. Run the SQL commands from `database/schema.sql`

### Step 4: Add JWT Secret
Replace this line in your `.env.local`:
```bash
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here_minimum_32_characters_required_for_security
```

With a secure random string (32+ characters):
```bash
JWT_SECRET=my_super_secure_jwt_secret_at_least_32_chars_long_123456789
```

## 🧪 Test the Complete System

Once you've added the DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET:

### 1. Insert Dummy Data
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/insert-dummy-data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Create Admin User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin123", 
    "role": "admin"
  }'
```

### 3. Test Team Generation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/teams/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "matchId": "1",
    "strategy": "ai-guided-chatbot",
    "teamCount": 5
  }'
```

## 🎯 What You'll Have

Once the database is connected:

- **5 Sample Matches** with realistic data
- **150 Players** (11 active + 4 bench per team)
- **AI-Enhanced Team Generation** for all 8 strategies
- **Admin Panel** for data management
- **User Authentication** with role-based access
- **Real-time AI Recommendations** based on match conditions

## 🔍 Verification

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ No more "Neon DB not available" messages in the console
- ✅ API calls return data from your database instead of SportRadar
- ✅ Admin panel shows actual match and player counts
- ✅ Team generation uses your player data with AI analysis

## 📞 Need Help?

If you run into issues:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify your DATABASE_URL is correct
3. Ensure your database schema is properly set up
4. Test individual API endpoints with curl or Postman
