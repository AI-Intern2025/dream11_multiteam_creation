# Strategy 6: Role Enhancement Based on Preset Focus

## Overview
Enhanced Strategy 6 to automatically adjust role distributions and player prioritization based on preset focus areas.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Dynamic Role Distribution
- **Bowling-focused presets**: Automatically maximize bowlers (5 bowlers, 3 batsmen)
- **Batting-focused presets**: Automatically maximize batsmen (5 batsmen, 2 bowlers)
- **Team A powerful presets**: Prioritize Team A players with bonus scoring
- **Team B focused presets**: Prioritize Team B players with bonus scoring

### 2. Preset-Specific Player Scoring

#### Bowling-Focused Presets
- **Bowlers**: +35 bonus score
- **All-rounders**: +15 bonus score
- **Triggered by**: Names containing "bowling", "bowler", "pace", "spin"

#### Batting-Focused Presets
- **Batsmen**: +35 bonus score
- **All-rounders**: +15 bonus score
- **Triggered by**: Names containing "batting", "batsmen", "run", "high"

#### Team-Specific Presets
- **Team A Focus**: +40 bonus score for Team A players
- **Team B Focus**: +40 bonus score for Team B players
- **Triggered by**: Names containing "team a", "team b", "powerful", "home", "away"

#### Specialized Conditions
- **Spin-friendly**: +30 bonus for spin bowlers
- **Pace-friendly**: +30 bonus for fast/medium bowlers
- **High-scoring**: +25 bonus for batsmen
- **Low-scoring**: +25 bonus for bowlers

### 3. Enhanced Role Distribution Algorithm

```typescript
// Bowling-focused presets
if (presetName.includes('bowling')) {
  enhancedRoles.bowlers = 5;     // Maximum bowlers
  enhancedRoles.batsmen = 3;     // Reduced batsmen
  enhancedRoles.allRounders = 2; // Balanced all-rounders
  enhancedRoles.wicketKeepers = 1; // Standard keeper
}

// Batting-focused presets
if (presetName.includes('batting')) {
  enhancedRoles.batsmen = 5;     // Maximum batsmen
  enhancedRoles.bowlers = 2;     // Reduced bowlers
  enhancedRoles.allRounders = 3; // Increased all-rounders
  enhancedRoles.wicketKeepers = 1; // Standard keeper
}
```

### 4. Existing Presets That Benefit

#### Bowling-Focused
- **"Bowlers Paradise: Low Scoring Match"** - Already has 5 bowlers, gets additional bowler scoring
- **Pace/Spin-friendly conditions** - Specialized bowler bonuses

#### Batting-Focused
- **"Team A High Total"** - Gets batsmen prioritization
- **"Team B High Total"** - Gets batsmen prioritization
- **High-scoring match scenarios** - Batsmen bonuses

#### Team-Specific
- **"Team A Powerful"** - Team A players get priority
- **"Team B Focused"** - Team B players get priority

### 5. Implementation Details

#### File: `lib/preset-strategy-service.ts`
- **Method**: `getEnhancedRoleDistribution()` - Determines optimal role distribution
- **Method**: `applyPresetSpecificScoring()` - Applies preset-specific player bonuses
- **Integration**: Seamlessly works with existing diversity algorithm

#### Key Features
- **Maintains 25% diversity** between teams
- **Respects Dream11 constraints** (credit limits, team limits)
- **Preserves preset-defined distributions** when explicitly set
- **Fallback to enhanced logic** when no distribution specified

### 6. Testing Examples

#### Bowling Preset Example
```typescript
// Preset: "Bowlers Paradise: Low Scoring Match"
// Result: 5 bowlers, 3 batsmen, 2 all-rounders, 1 wicket-keeper
// Bonus: All bowlers get +35 score, all-rounders get +15 score
```

#### Team A Preset Example
```typescript
// Preset: "Team A High Total"
// Result: 5 batsmen, 2 bowlers, 3 all-rounders, 1 wicket-keeper
// Bonus: Team A players get +40 score, batsmen get +35 score
```

## Benefits
1. **Automatic Optimization**: No manual role distribution needed
2. **Contextual Intelligence**: Adapts to preset focus automatically
3. **Maintained Diversity**: Still ensures 25% minimum different players
4. **Flexible Implementation**: Works with both explicit and implicit configurations

## Compatibility
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing presets continue to work
- **Enhanced Automatically**: New intelligence applied to all presets
- **Preserves Constraints**: Respects all Dream11 rules and limits
