# üèè Multi Team Creation Assistant ‚Äî Detailed Project Workflow

Below is the comprehensive end‚Äëto‚Äëend workflow for both Admin and User sides of the project, including 8 distinct team‚Äëcreation strategies, and points where we integrate our three related internship modules:

- Pre‚ÄëMatch Team Creation Assistant
- Summary of Teams Created
- Fantasy Performance Tracker

---

## üöÄ 1. ADMIN FLOW

### 1. **Upload Fixture**
- Admin navigates to **Admin ‚Üí Fixtures** and clicks **"Upload CSV"**.
- A CSV of upcoming fixtures (e.g. `ENG vs IND Test`, `PAK vs NZ ODI`, `AUS vs WI T20`) is ingested.

### 2. **Pull & Review Fixtures**
- System displays parsed fixtures.  
- Admin selects a fixture to configure.

### 3. **Upload Lineup Screenshot**
- Admin uploads the Dream11 "Create Team" screenshot for that fixture.
- E.g. the XI view showing credits, roles, selection %.

### 4. **OCR + Classification + CRUD Panel**
- **OCR** reads player names, roles, credits, teams.
- **CRUD panel** shows each record:
  - If "All values read correctly?" ‚Üí click **Publish Match**  
  - If "No" ‚Üí admin edits fields manually ‚Üí then **Publish Match**  

### 5. **Upload Natural‚ÄêLanguage Match Data**
- Admin can paste or upload **pitch reports**, **form summaries**, **storyline notes** (leveraging Pre‚ÄëMatch Team Creation Assistant's knowledge base).
- System "studies" these texts (indexed in our AI knowledge store).

### 6. **Publish Match**
- After either path, the fixture goes live for users:
  - **Player pool** imported  
  - **Credits & roles** stored  
  - **NL context** (pitch, narrative) tagged  

---

## üéØ 2. USER WORKFLOW

### 1. **List of Published Matches**  
- User opens the home page: sees cards for each fixture (e.g. `ENG vs IND`, `PAK vs NZ`, `AUS vs WI`).

### 2. **Select Match & Teams Count**  
- Clicks on the desired match.  
- Prompt: **"How many teams would you like to create?"** (e.g. 10, 15, 20).

### 3. **Choose Team‚ÄëCreation Strategy**  
- **Question**: "What do you want to base your teams on?"  
- Eight strategy flows branch out from here:

---

### üîπ Strategy 1: AI‚ÄëGuided Chatbot (Pre‚ÄëMatch Team Creation Assistant)

  - "Who do you think will win?"  
  - "What final score range?"  
  - "Any players you're backing?"  
  - "Which story will unfold?"  
- **System** synthesizes answers into constraints.  
- **Selection Summariser** recap:
  > "You chose Team A to win, backing Player X as VC, focusing on high‚Äëscoring batters."  
- **Generate X Teams** applying those constraints.

> *Integrates our "Pre‚ÄëMatch Team Creation Assistant" module here.*

---

### üîπ Strategy 2: Same XI, Different Captains
- **Opens Create‚ÄëTeam UI** showing the 11 selected players.

  - "Will Team A concede High/Medium/Low wickets?"  
  - Same for Team B.  
- **Save Predictions**.  
- **Summariser** explains:
  > "You expect a batting pitch; Team A will rack up 200+, Team B will collapse."  
- **Generate X Teams** stacking top‚Äëorder batters of Team A, bowlers of Team B.

---

### üîπ Strategy 4: Core‚ÄëHedge Player Selection
- **Opens Create‚ÄëTeam UI**:
  - "Select players for 75%+ of teams"  
  - "Select players for ~50% of teams"  
  - "Select players for 1‚Äì2 teams"  
  - "Order your C/VC"
