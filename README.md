# 🏏 Multi Team Creation Assistant — Detailed Project Workflow

Below is the comprehensive end‑to‑end workflow for both Admin and User sides of the project, including 8 distinct team‑creation strategies, and points where we integrate our three related internship modules:

- Pre‑Match Team Creation Assistant
- Summary of Teams Created
- Fantasy Performance Tracker

---

## 🚀 1. ADMIN FLOW

### 1. **Upload Fixture**
- Admin navigates to **Admin → Fixtures** and clicks **"Upload CSV"**.
- A CSV of upcoming fixtures (e.g. `ENG vs IND Test`, `PAK vs NZ ODI`, `AUS vs WI T20`) is ingested.

### 2. **Pull & Review Fixtures**
- System displays parsed fixtures.  
- Admin selects a fixture to configure.

### 3. **Upload Lineup Screenshot**
- Admin uploads the Dream11 "Create Team" screenshot for that fixture.
- E.g. the XI view showing credits, roles, selection %.

### 4. **OCR + Classification + CRUD Panel**
- **OCR** reads player names, roles, credits, teams.
- **CRUD panel** shows each record:
  - If "All values read correctly?" → click **Publish Match**  
  - If "No" → admin edits fields manually → then **Publish Match**  

### 5. **Upload Natural‐Language Match Data**
- Admin can paste or upload **pitch reports**, **form summaries**, **storyline notes** (leveraging Pre‑Match Team Creation Assistant's knowledge base).
- System "studies" these texts (indexed in our AI knowledge store).

### 6. **Publish Match**
- After either path, the fixture goes live for users:
  - **Player pool** imported  
  - **Credits & roles** stored  
  - **NL context** (pitch, narrative) tagged  

---

## 🎯 2. USER WORKFLOW

### 1. **List of Published Matches**  
- User opens the home page: sees cards for each fixture (e.g. `ENG vs IND`, `PAK vs NZ`, `AUS vs WI`).

### 2. **Select Match & Teams Count**  
- Clicks on the desired match.  
- Prompt: **"How many teams would you like to create?"** (e.g. 10, 15, 20).

### 3. **Choose Team‑Creation Strategy**  
- **Question**: "What do you want to base your teams on?"  
- Eight strategy flows branch out from here:

---

### 🔹 Strategy 1: AI‑Guided Chatbot (Pre‑Match Team Creation Assistant)
- **Opens Chatbot UI** (pill‑based Q&A):
  - "Who do you think will win?"  
  - "What final score range?"  
  - "Any players you're backing?"  
  - "Which story will unfold?"  
- **System** synthesizes answers into constraints.  
- **Selection Summariser** recap:
  > "You chose Team A to win, backing Player X as VC, focusing on high‑scoring batters."  
- **Generate X Teams** applying those constraints.

> *Integrates our "Pre‑Match Team Creation Assistant" module here.*

---

### 🔹 Strategy 2: Same XI, Different Captains
- **Opens Create‑Team UI** showing the 11 selected players.  
- User **orders** them by C/VC preference.
- (Optional) User can **upload** another XI screenshot to import new baseline.  
- **Selection Summariser**:
  > "Your core XI locked — rotating C/VC across 15 teams."  
- **Generate X Teams** varying only C/VC.

---

### 🔹 Strategy 3: Score & Storyline Prediction
- **Opens Prediction Form**:
  - "Will Team A score High/Medium/Low runs?"  
  - "Will Team A concede High/Medium/Low wickets?"  
  - Same for Team B.  
- **Save Predictions**.  
- **Summariser** explains:
  > "You expect a batting pitch; Team A will rack up 200+, Team B will collapse."  
- **Generate X Teams** stacking top‑order batters of Team A, bowlers of Team B.

---

### 🔹 Strategy 4: Core‑Hedge Player Selection
- **Opens Create‑Team UI**:
  - "Select players for 75%+ of teams"  
  - "Select players for ~50% of teams"  
  - "Select players for 1–2 teams"  
  - "Order your C/VC"  
- **Save Plan** then **Summariser**:
  > "Your core 6 locked, hedging 4 picks across 12 teams."  
- **Generate X Teams** mixing core and hedge picks.

---

### 🔹 Strategy 5: Stats‑Driven Guardrails
- **Form** to set numerical filters:
  - Dream Team % between X–Y  
  - Selection % between A–B  
  - Avg Points between M–N  
- **Save Guardrails**.  
- **Summariser**:
  > "Generating teams with only in‑form all‑rounders and high‑value batters."  
- **Generate X Teams** meeting those stats filters.

---

### 🔹 Strategy 6: Preset Scenarios / Configurations
- **Form** to choose from presets:
  - "Team A high total, Team B collapse"  
  - "High differentials"  
  - "Balanced roles: 4 BAT, 3 BOWL, 2 AR, 1 WK"  
  - Etc…  
- **Save Config** → **Summariser** → **Generate X Teams**.

---

### 🔹 Strategy 7: Role‑Split Lineups
- **Form** to define role ratios:
  - Top / Middle / Lower order split  
  - Spinners vs Pacers ratio  
- **Save Config** → **Summariser** → **Generate X Teams**.

---

### 🔹 Strategy 8: Base Team + Rule‑Based Edits
- **Opens Create‑Team UI** with baseline XI.  
- **Define Rules**:
  - Optimization parameter (e.g. Dream Team %)
  - Guardrails (# per role, # per real team)
  - Preferences (more spinners vs pacers, top vs middle order)  
- **Save Rules** → **Summariser** → **Generate X Teams** applying minor edits per team.

---

## 🔄 Complete User Journey Example

### Example: User Creating 15 Teams for ENG vs IND Test

1. **Match Selection**: User clicks "ENG vs IND Test" card on homepage
2. **Team Count**: Selects "15 teams" from dropdown
3. **Strategy Choice**: Chooses "AI-Guided Chatbot" strategy
4. **Chatbot Interaction**:
   - "I think India will win by 50+ runs"
   - "Expecting 350+ first innings total"
   - "Backing Kohli and Bumrah strongly"
   - "Weather will favor spinners"
5. **AI Processing**: System synthesizes preferences into team generation constraints
6. **Team Generation**: 15 teams created with varied compositions but aligned to user preferences
7. **Summary View**: Portfolio analysis showing player distribution and strategy effectiveness
8. **Export**: Teams downloaded in Dream11-compatible CSV format

This workflow captures the entire journey from fixture ingestion through team creation and performance tracking, with clear integration points for our three related internship projects.
