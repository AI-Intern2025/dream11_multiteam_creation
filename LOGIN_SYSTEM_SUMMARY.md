# Login System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Fantasy Team Creation Assistant now has a complete login system as the first page of the website, implementing role-based authentication with Admin and User access levels.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Login as First Page
- **URL**: http://localhost:3001 automatically redirects to `/login` if user is not authenticated
- **Authentication Check**: All routes are protected except login and API auth routes
- **Middleware Protection**: Implemented middleware to check authentication for all routes

### 2. Role-Based Authentication

#### Admin Account
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Privileges**: 
  - Access to Admin Panel (`/admin`)
  - Match and player data upload capabilities
  - Full system access

#### User Accounts
- **Username**: `user` | **Password**: `user123`
- **Username**: `demo` | **Password**: `demo123`
- **Privileges**:
  - Access to match selection and team creation
  - View and generate fantasy teams
  - Use AI-powered team strategies

### 3. Login Page Features
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional login interface
- **Demo Credentials**: Clearly displayed demo credentials for testing
- **Dual Forms**: Login and Registration tabs
- **Input Validation**: Form validation and error handling
- **Success Feedback**: Toast notifications for login status
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators

### 4. Authentication Flow

#### Login Process
1. User visits any URL → Redirected to `/login` if not authenticated
2. User enters credentials → Authentication checked against demo users
3. Successful login → JWT token generated and stored
4. Role-based redirect:
   - **Admin** → `/admin` (Admin Panel)
   - **User** → `/` (Match Selection)

#### Logout Process
1. User clicks logout button in header
2. Authentication token cleared
3. Redirect to `/login` page

### 5. UI/UX Enhancements
- **Header Updates**: Shows welcome message with username and role
- **Admin Panel Access**: Only visible to admin users
- **Logout Button**: Prominent logout option in header
- **Role Indicators**: Visual indicators showing user role

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created
1. **`app/page.tsx`** - Added authentication checks and redirects
2. **`app/login/page.tsx`** - Enhanced with demo credentials display
3. **`middleware.ts`** - Route protection middleware
4. **`lib/auth.ts`** - Demo user authentication system
5. **`hooks/use-auth.ts`** - Authentication state management

### Authentication System
- **Demo Mode**: Uses hardcoded demo users for immediate testing
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Local Storage**: Client-side token persistence
- **Role Validation**: Server-side role checking

### Security Features
