## Captain/Vice-Captain Selection Fix Summary

### **Problem:**
Some teams were being assigned 2 captains or 2 vice-captains instead of exactly 1 captain and 1 vice-captain per team.

### **Root Cause:**
Multiple captain selection methods had insufficient safety checks to ensure captain and vice-captain were different players. Index calculations could result in the same player being selected for both roles.

### **Methods Fixed:**

#### 1. **`selectCaptainAndViceCaptain` (Strategy 8)**
**Issue:** Index calculation could result in same player for both roles
**Fix:** Added comprehensive safety checks:
- Validates team has at least 2 players
- Ensures captain and vice-captain indices are different
- Final safety check to force different players if same player selected
- Proper error handling for edge cases

#### 2. **`forceVariedCaptainSelection` (General team generation)**
**Issue:** Fallback logic could assign same player to both roles
**Fix:** Added final safety check:
- Validates captain and vice-captain are different
- Finds alternative vice-captain if same player selected
- Logs warnings when conflicts occur

#### 3. **`selectMLOptimizedCaptains` (ML-based teams)**
**Issue:** No safety checks for duplicate captain/vice-captain assignment
**Fix:** Added comprehensive safety validation:
- Ensures captain and vice-captain are different players
- Finds alternative vice-captain if conflict occurs
- Maintains ML optimization while ensuring different players

#### 4. **`selectCaptainsFromFilteredPlayers` (Stats-driven teams)**
**Status:** Already had proper safety checks - no changes needed

### **Safety Measures Added:**
1. **Pre-selection validation**: Check team size before selection
2. **Index conflict prevention**: Ensure different indices for captain/vice-captain
3. **Post-selection validation**: Final check to ensure different players
4. **Alternative selection**: Fallback logic to find different players
5. **Logging**: Clear warnings when conflicts are detected and resolved

### **Testing Enhancement:**
Updated test script to validate captain/vice-captain selection:
- Checks that captain and vice-captain are different players
- Logs errors if same player assigned to both roles
- Confirms proper captain/vice-captain assignment

### **Expected Outcome:**
- Every team will have exactly 1 captain and 1 vice-captain
- Captain and vice-captain will always be different players
- Clear error logging if conflicts occur during selection
- Robust fallback logic to handle edge cases

This fix ensures that the fundamental Dream11 rule of "1 captain + 1 vice-captain per team" is always enforced across all team generation strategies.
